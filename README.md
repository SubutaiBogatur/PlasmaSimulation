# PlasmaSimulation
Physics first year course work of students Jurii Tikhonov and Aleksandr Tukallo of ITMO university, St.Petersburg.
Our goal is to create a multifunctional tool for elementary processes in plasma modeling.

Current version: 0.3

Functionality to plot wave functions of hydrogen only electron at different layers was added.

Short-term goals:
1)Improving project structure
2)Adding LD\ST methods
3)Adding functionality to plot hydrogen-like electrons' wave functions

Long-term goals:
1)Adding 3D graphics to illustrate probability of finding an electron in different space points
